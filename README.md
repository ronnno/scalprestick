A Scalping resistant ticketing system for large scale sporting events and music concerts

The system balances conflicting needs:
* Privacy
* Free transfer of purchased tickets
* Scalping resistance

Competing event organizers and venues trust-less sharing of ticket purchase history to intelligently detect scalping attempts before tickets are sold. Optional ID sampling at the gate provides a second control against illicit tickets trade. Ticket transferring mechanism requires high trust between transferring parties to discourage trade.
